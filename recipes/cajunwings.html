    <h3>
        What is this?
    </h3>

    <p>These days, "Cajun spice" is about as far from trendy as you can get. But back when I graduated culinary school, it was pure cutting edge. Chef Paul Prudhomme was rolling around K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen in his motorized scooter throwing this stuff around like some kind of magic dust. His most famous dish was blackened red fish, which involved coating the fish with a thick layer of Cajun spice, after which it was seared on a red-hot skillet until literally black.</p>

    <p>People loved it, and started making it at homeâ€¦after removing the batteries from their smoke detectors. That trend died out fairly quickly, since the technique is much better suited to a restaurant-quality ventilation system, but the Cajun spice trend kept going strong for years, with everyone from Michelin Star chefs to snack bar cooks sprinkling it on all sorts of things.</p>

    <h3>
        Ingredients
    </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
        <li>2 pounds chicken wings, split and tips discarded</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        Steps:
    </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare spice rub by combining baking powder, salt, garlic powder, and onion powder, cumin, paprika, cayenne, black pepper, oregano, and thyme in a small bowl. Mix until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Place wings in a large bowl and toss in 3 tablespoons spice rub. Toss wings with tongs until thoroughly and evenly coated. Transfer to a baking rack set over a parchment-lined sheet pan. Sprinkle a little more spice rub over each wing and let sit for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Prepare remoulade sauce by crushing capers in a mixing bowl with the back of a fork. Add mayonnaise, Dijon, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, cayenne, paprika, garlic, green onion, parsley, and lemon juice; whisk to combine. Taste and add salt if needed. Cover and refrigerate until needed.</li>
        <li>Bake wings in the center of the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Flip and continue to bake until beautifully browned, no longer pink at the bone, and the juices run clear, 20 to 25 minutes longer. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
